//! Player ECS state.
//!
//! The ECS player entity is the frame-to-frame authority for player movement,
//! health, combat timers, and interaction buffering. All player state lives on
//! ECS components; do not reintroduce a god-object runtime resource.
//!
//! Submodules:
//! - [`components`] — the per-frame ECS components on the player entity.
//! - [`movement_components`] — re-exports of the 18 player cluster
//!   components from [`ambition_engine_core::body_clusters`]. These
//!   replaced the (now-deleted) `PlayerMovementAuthority` /
//!   `PlayerBody` aggregates in the cluster-native migration
//!   (finalized 2026-05-28).
//! - [`bundles`]    — [`PlayerSimulationBundle`] for spawning a sim-side player.
//! - [`events`]     — player-domain message types.
//! - [`systems`]    — frame systems that read or sync the player components.
//! - [`affordances`] — "what would each button do right now?" table +
//!   HUD/input-glyph support.
//! - [`queries`]    — singleton-vs-multiplayer-explicit player query helpers.
//! - [`ledge_grab`] / [`swim`] — thin sandbox shims over engine-owned
//!   ledge-grab and water mechanics (constants + end-to-end test fixtures).

// never through the player module). The genuinely player-only state stays below.
