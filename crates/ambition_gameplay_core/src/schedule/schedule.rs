//! `crate::platformer_runtime::schedule::PlatformerRuntimeSet` names the

/// `CoreSimulation`, ordered by [`configure_sandbox_sets`]. External

/// `.after(CoreSimulation)`) and that constraint covers all six
/// sub-phases.
///
/// The remaining variants (`FeatureCollection`, `FeatureInteraction`,
/// …) are top-level sets that run after `CoreSimulation` in their own
/// chain. `ResetProcessing` and `Trace` are tail consumers configured
/// `.after(CoreSimulation)` without joining the main chain.
/// Startup-phase slot for the app's presentation setup (camera, root
/// UI scaffolding). Machinery that must initialize after presentation
/// setup (e.g. audio channel/cue loading) orders `.after(this set)`
/// instead of naming the app's setup system.
