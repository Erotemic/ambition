//! The ONE canonical bevy_lunex 3D-cube inventory renderer (#31).
//!
//! Generic over the host's `PageId`/`Action`: the host publishes the ordered
//! faces via [`ActiveMenuPages`], and [`KaleidoscopeMenuPlugin`] spawns a pause
//! `Camera3d` + a ring of bevy_lunex faces, rebuilds them when the pages change,
//! rotates the ring so the active face turns to the camera, and folds the faces
//! open/closed in the OoT "subscreen" style.
//!
//! This module is the consolidation of what used to be two drifted copies (the
//! `ambition_mock_demo` private cube and an earlier lib re-port). The demo's
//! look/fold/rotation/button-layout is the visual reference and is reproduced
//! here faithfully, generalized over N pages.
//!
//! ## Tuning seam
//! All geometry/speeds/visual knobs live in [`KaleidoscopeMenuConfig`] (a `Resource`).
//! The plugin inserts a default if the host has not; the host (or demo) may
//! insert its own before adding the plugin to match its exact values.
