//! Intro-v1 route-state chained flags.
//!
//! When the player picks up certain narrative pickups (Bob's field survey,
//! the system boss's P5 reward, etc.) the slice wants secondary flags to
//! flip too — `map_private_marks_unlocked`, `route_memory_received`, and
//! similar map-layer hooks that downstream listeners can subscribe to
//! without watching for the specific source flag.
//!
//! Implemented as a tiny system that runs after [`apply_flag_effects`] each
//! frame: it reads the save layer, walks the static [`INTRO_FLAG_CHAINS`]
//! table, and emits a fresh `GameplayEffect::SetFlag` for any chained flag
//! whose trigger is set but whose target is still missing. The chained
//! emission then flows through `apply_flag_effects` next frame, which
//! writes it to save and pushes a `QuestAdvanceEvent::FlagSet` so quest
//! steps that listen on the chained flag advance automatically.
//!
//! Keeping the chain as a const data table (not a switch arm in
//! `apply_flag_effects`) means new intro chains are one-line edits and the
//! bus stays generic.
//!
//! The system is idempotent: the second time it observes a trigger that
//! has already set its target it sees the target flag present and skips.
