# Lessons learned

This journal records unexpected errors encountered while iterating on the Ambition sandbox, especially places where an overlay or generated build script looked reasonable but failed in a real local/device test. The goal is to make future LLM-generated patches less likely to repeat the same mistakes.

## 2026-05-08: Android APK bring-up

### Prefer generated Android projects, but keep the generated Java/Gradle side explicit

The first Android APK path successfully built the Rust shared library with `cargo-ndk`, but Gradle/device launch uncovered several Java-side assumptions. Each failure happened before Bevy gameplay started, so the fix belonged in the generated Android shell rather than in gameplay code.

Observed fixes:

- `android.useAndroidX=true` is required because GameActivity is distributed through AndroidX artifacts.
- The manifest should launch an app-local `.MainActivity`, not a Maven-coordinate-looking class such as `androidx.games.activity.GameActivity`.
- `MainActivity` should extend `com.google.androidgamesdk.GameActivity`.
- GameActivity extends `AppCompatActivity`, so the app needs both `androidx.appcompat:appcompat` and an AppCompat-derived theme.
- Transitive Kotlin dependencies may mix old `kotlin-stdlib-jdk7/jdk8` artifacts with newer `kotlin-stdlib`; the generated Gradle project now aligns Kotlin artifacts and excludes obsolete compatibility jars.
- A repo-local Gradle user home under `target/android/gradle-user-home` avoids unrelated host `~/.gradle` cache permissions breaking this project.

### Do not assume adb install flags are portable

I suggested `adb install --no-stream`, but the target device rejected it as an unknown package-manager option. The build script should prefer conservative install flags (`-r -d --install-location 0`) and provide a `--fresh-install` mode that force-stops/uninstalls first.

### Overlay patches must not clobber platform entrypoints

A later Android usability overlay replaced `crates/ambition_sandbox/src/lib.rs` from a source snapshot that did not contain the Android shared-library entry point. The APK still built and installed, but launch failed with:

```text
UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol "android_main" referenced by libambition_sandbox.so
```

The lesson is that files touched by multiple overlay series need special care. Before overwriting `lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, or generated build scripts, preserve platform-critical entrypoints and feature definitions added by earlier overlays.

For Bevy Android GameActivity builds, the Rust library must export `android_main`. In this project the intended pattern is:

```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "android")]
#[bevy::prelude::bevy_main]
fn main() {
    app::run_visible();
}
```

Desktop still enters through `src/main.rs`; Android packages the library as `libambition_sandbox.so` and needs Bevy's `#[bevy_main]` macro to generate the Android boilerplate.

### Keep asset behavior platform-aware

Android packages runtime assets into the APK. Host-side `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/assets/...` existence checks are not valid on-device. On Android, let Bevy's APK asset reader attempt the load; on desktop, host-side existence checks are still useful for clearer diagnostics.

### Treat device logs as the source of truth

The Android sequence progressed through distinct phases:

1. APK installed but manifest activity class was missing.
2. Java activity compiled but AppCompat dependency/theme was missing.
3. Native library loaded but `android_main` was missing.

Each phase required a different layer of the stack to be fixed. Avoid guessing from the symptom alone; use `adb logcat` and identify whether the failure is Gradle, install/package-manager, Java activity startup, native library loading, or Rust/Bevy runtime.
