# Headless simulation

Ambition's sandbox ships two binaries:

- `cargo run -p ambition_sandbox` — the visible Bevy app (windowed gameplay)
- `cargo run -p ambition_sandbox --bin headless [TICKS]` — a no-display
  simulation runner that drives the **full gameplay loop**

Both depend on the `ambition_sandbox` library crate, which owns the module
graph and the cross-cutting resources (`GameWorld`, `SandboxRuntime`). The
visible binary's `main.rs` is the existing playable shell; the headless
binary is a thin shim around `ambition_sandbox::run_headless`.

> **Phase status (2026-05-07):** Phase 1 (no-display tick), Phase 2
> (gameplay loop runs headless), and the **first half of Phase 3** (RL
> adapter API) are all complete. The events refactor (ADR 0012, slices
> `c49c1e5`–`81900dd`) shipped end-to-end; `sandbox_update` emits
> `SfxMessage`/`VfxMessage`/`DebrisBurstMessage` and presentation
> subscribers consume them, so the simulation has no presentation
> coupling. Remaining Phase 3 work: fixed-timestep determinism + RNG
> seeding + a Python binding via PyO3.

This document describes the sim/presentation contract the headless runner
exposes today.

## What headless does today (Phases 1 + 2)

`run_headless(max_ticks)` constructs a Bevy `App` via
`add_simulation_plugins(app)` — `MinimalPlugins`, `AssetPlugin`,
`StatesPlugin`, the LDtk runtime spine, the state-machine plugin, the
physics plugin, and the simulation systems including `sandbox_update`. It
ticks `Update` `max_ticks` times and returns a `HeadlessReport`
summarizing what ran. It validates that:

- the embedded LDtk world parses and validates,
- the runtime `RoomSet` and `LdtkRuntimeIndex` construct from LDtk,
- the runtime-spine systems (`sync_plugin_spawned_ambition_entities`,
  `rebuild_ldtk_runtime_spine_index`, `rebuild_ldtk_runtime_solid_index`,
  `poll_ldtk_file_changes`) compile and tick on a no-display machine,
- `sandbox_update` and the gameplay loop tick to completion under
  scripted `ControlFrame` input without touching presentation.

It does NOT install `bevy_ecs_ldtk::LdtkPlugin`, because that plugin's tile
spawning depends on Bevy's image/render plugins. Without LDtk-spawned
entities the runtime-spine systems run as no-ops on tile data; entities
still spawn through the `sync_plugin_spawned_ambition_entities` path
when the simulation seeds them.

## What headless deliberately does NOT do

The presentation layer is excluded by construction:
`add_presentation_plugins(app)` (which the visible binary calls and the
headless binary does not) installs `DefaultPlugins`, `EguiPlugin`,
`MaterialUiPlugin`, `InputManagerPlugin`, the dialog plugin, the
inspector, audio mixers, and the HUD/VFX subscriber systems that consume
the simulation's `SfxMessage` / `VfxMessage` / `DebrisBurstMessage`
output. The headless binary skips this layer and so:

- emits but does not realize SFX/VFX events,
- does not spawn Camera2d, player Sprite, or HUD Text,
- does not start the Kira audio engine,
- does not read `ButtonInput<KeyCode>` (input is supplied as
  `ControlFrame` values).

Scripted gameplay tests in `crates/ambition_sandbox/tests/scripted_gameplay.rs`
inject `ControlFrame`s and assert on emitted message counts.

## Phase 3 — RL adapter (in progress)

The first half of the RL adapter has landed in
`crates/ambition_sandbox/src/rl.rs`. It exposes:

- **`AgentAction`** — sparse per-tick intent struct (move x/y, jump,
  jump_held, dash, attack, blink, interact, projectile, fly_toggle,
  reset, aim x/y, …). All fields default to zero / false; agents can
  set just the knobs they care about. `From<AgentAction> for ControlFrame`
  does the conversion at the seam.
- **`AgentObservation`** — owned `String` / primitive-tuple snapshot of
  player pos/vel/size, on_ground/on_wall/clinging/climbing flags,
  facing, fast_falling/fly/glide flags, dash_charges/air_jumps/blink
  state, hp / hp_max, mana / mana_max, time_alive, resets, body_mode
  label, active_room id, world_size, world_spawn, last_safe_pos, plus
  per-tick flags (`recently_damaged`, `in_hitstun`, `invincible`).
- **`SandboxSim::new()`** — builds the same App `run_headless` does
  (MinimalPlugins + AssetPlugin + ImagePlugin + TransformPlugin +
  StatesPlugin + `init_sandbox_resources` + `add_simulation_plugins`).
  Runs the first tick so the player and `SandboxRuntime` are spawned
  before the caller sees an observation. Returns `Err` on LDtk
  validation failure.
- **`sim.step(action)`** — writes the converted `ControlFrame` into the
  resource and calls `app.update()` once. Returns `AgentObservation`.
- **`sim.step_n(action, n)`** — convenience for "hold this action for
  n frames" without writing the loop.
- **`sim.reset_episode()`** — presses Reset for one frame, idles for
  one, returns the post-reset observation. Goes through the existing
  reset machinery rather than rebuilding the App.
- **`sim.world()` / `sim.world_mut()`** — escape hatches for advanced
  consumers (custom observation extractors, scripted teleports, etc.)
  that want to inspect / mutate ECS state directly.

The whole module is `Send` + thread-local; multi-threaded RL training
should keep one `SandboxSim` per worker.

Remaining Phase 3 work:

- **Determinism**: switch to a fixed timestep schedule for sim steps,
  seed any RNG gameplay uses, audit wall-clock reads. Currently
  `app.update()` is fine for sequential step-and-observe loops, but
  reproducing a trajectory after a checkpoint reload needs the timestep
  + seed pinning.
- **PyO3 binding**: a thin Python module exposing `SandboxSim` /
  `AgentAction` / `AgentObservation` so research code in Python can
  step the simulation without writing Rust glue. Not required for
  fuzz / scripted-replay use cases (which are happy in pure Rust).
- **`bevy_rl` evaluation**: see the parallel candidate in TODO C — we
  may converge `SandboxSim` toward the `bevy_rl` adapter shape if it
  buys us tooling we'd otherwise build from scratch.

## Visible-binary headless fallback

`run_visible` (the `cargo run -p ambition_sandbox --bin ambition_sandbox`
entry point) detects missing display before installing `DefaultPlugins`
and falls back to `run_headless`:

- Linux: if neither `DISPLAY` nor `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` nor `WAYLAND_SOCKET`
  is set, fall back.
- Any platform: if the user passed `--headless` on the CLI, fall back.
- Override the tick count with `--headless-ticks N` (default 120).

The fallback prints a one-line diagnostic to stderr so users on a
display-less VM see why their `cargo run` didn't open a window. The
dedicated `--bin headless` runner is still the recommended entry point
for CI / RL drivers that want to skip the visible-binary plugin
foundation entirely.

## Architecture notes that informed Phase 1

- The library/binary split is the cheapest way to share the module graph
  between the visible app and a headless driver. The presentation
  binary's `main.rs` is now ~10 lines (it just calls
  `ambition_sandbox::run_app`); systems and resources live in the
  library.
- `SandboxRuntime` and `GameWorld` moved to the library so submodules'
  `crate::` paths continue to resolve. They are still the SP-only shape
  per the architecture targets memory; future patches should migrate
  per-player state onto a Player entity.
- `SandboxRuntime` fields are `pub` (not `pub(crate)`) because the
  separate binary crates (`main`, `headless`, scripted gameplay tests
  in `tests/`) need access for HUD reads, scripted-input writes, and
  assertions. This is a structural consequence of the split, not a
  design preference; once HUD wiring fully moves to event subscribers
  these fields could tighten again.

## Verification

In the dev VM (no display, no GPU):

```bash
cargo test -p ambition_engine             # ~196 tests pass
cargo test -p ambition_sandbox            # ~330 tests pass
cargo run -p ambition_sandbox --bin headless 30
```

The last command prints a `HeadlessReport` summary and exits 0. Test
counts grow as coverage expands — the count above is a snapshot, not a
guarantee. The relevant invariant is "exit code 0, no panic."
