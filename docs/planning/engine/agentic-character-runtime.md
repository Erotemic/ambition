# Agentic character runtime — Engine 1.0 program

**State:** OPEN / LATER — architecture direction is useful now; implementation should wait for actor/navigation/world-fact foundations.

## Goal

Let persistent characters pursue goals, move through the world, choose engine
actions and participate in dialogue without giving an AI model authority to
rewrite simulation truth.

This is broader than combat `Brain` behavior and narrower than "LLM controls the
game".

## Layering

```text
authoritative world + actor facts
        ↓
observations / memory / goals
        ↓
planner or policy
        ↓
typed engine action intent
        ↓
ordinary actor/control/interact systems
```

LLM-backed reasoning, scripted planners, utility AI and deterministic fallback
brains should be interchangeable policy providers above the same action seam.

## Requirements

- typed action vocabulary rather than free-form mutation;
- deterministic simulation remains authoritative;
- planning failure/timeouts degrade to safe behavior;
- NPC movement uses ordinary navigation/body mechanics;
- dialogue context comes from structured facts/memory;
- headless inspection can explain goal, plan, action and rejection reason;
- no dependency from low-level actor/world crates on an LLM service.

## Candidate crate / Bevy ecosystem value

A small generic "agent controller" plugin could become ecosystem-worthy if it
only defines observation/action/planner contracts and does not assume Ambition's
story or remote model provider. Any actual LLM service adapter should be a
separate optional crate/tool boundary.

## Open design questions — deliberately unresolved

- Which decisions must be deterministic for rollback/network play?
- Can remote/LLM decisions be authoritative, advisory, or only outside rollback
  windows?
- What is the offline/no-model fallback?
- How much world context can an actor inspect directly?
- How are long-running goals represented and interrupted?
- How should characters coordinate or negotiate shared plans?
- What is the latency/cost budget for model-backed characters?
- What safety/content constraints belong in the game rather than the engine?
