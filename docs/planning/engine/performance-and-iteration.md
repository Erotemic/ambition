# Performance and iteration

**State:** OPEN engine-product program.

## Goal

Treat performance and iteration speed as part of engine quality, not as an
occasional optimization campaign.

A Unity/Godot competitor must be pleasant to build with as well as capable at
runtime. Ambition is the primary measurement customer; acceptance games and
minimal external consumers reveal different dependency/capability footprints.

## Measurement families

### Compile and dependency topology

Track:

- clean and incremental build cost of major crates/apps;
- change amplification after representative edits;
- high-fan-in foundations;
- capability footprint for minimal consumers;
- effect of actor-monolith/shared-tangle/runtime extractions.

Use measurements to choose ownership boundaries. Do not carve solely to make a
line count smaller.

### Runtime simulation

Track representative costs for:

- actor/brain phases;
- collision and dynamic world geometry;
- rollback save/load/resimulation;
- portals and unusual rendering features;
- multiple resident rooms;
- multiple local views.

### Rendering and quality profiles

Quality profiles should cover all expensive presentation features coherently,
including texture/sprite resolution, portals, lighting/VFX and multi-view
rendering. Desktop and Android defaults may differ while the authored content
identity remains the same.

### Asset residency

Continue [`../sprite-residency-and-live-quality.md`](../sprite-residency-and-live-quality.md)
and broaden the model where other asset classes need similar residency/quality
policy.

### Authoring iteration

Measure the edit -> validate -> preview/hot-reload loop for LDtk and other content
pipelines. A feature that takes minutes of opaque regeneration to inspect is an
engine ergonomics problem even if runtime is fast.

### Headless throughput

Headless simulation, replay, fighter evaluation and automated acceptance tests
should remain cheap enough to be used as development tools.

## Rules

- record the workload and machine/context with a number;
- prefer representative bounded benchmarks over permanent giant sweeps;
- optimize a measured dominant cost, not an old campaign's baseline;
- distinguish compile/link time, test execution time, asset generation time and
  runtime frame cost;
- preserve correctness/authoring clarity before micro-optimizing;
- avoid NPM-based tooling when a Python/native tool is practical for repository
  workflows.

## Near-term opportunities

- continue actor-monolith decomposition where dependency isolation improves
  incremental builds;
- measure the dynamic-world collision overlay while moving-platform architecture
  is touched;
- establish multi-view rendering baselines before split-screen grows expensive;
- keep Android quality/residency profiles within device budgets;
- retain lean mastered soundtrack/sprite authoring diagnostics rather than
  generating maximal preview artifacts by default.

## Acceptance

The repository should be able to answer, with current measurements, what makes a
common edit slow, what capabilities a minimal game actually pulls in, what
runtime features dominate a representative frame, and which quality/residency
profile is appropriate for a target platform.
