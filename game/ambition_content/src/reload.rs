//! Reload every move table from disk into a RUNNING host.
//!
//! ⭐⭐ **THIS IS THE CUSTOMER THE REVISION ROAD DID NOT HAVE.** MEASURED
//! 2026-09-11 before writing it: `activate_staged_revision` and
//! `stage_character_revision` had ZERO callers outside `prepared.rs` and its own
//! tests. A transactional cast revision — staged, admitted against installed
//! technique support, published under a new generation, refused without touching
//! the last-good cast, and now refused when it was prepared against a cast that
//! has since moved — existed complete and was reached by nothing. Same shape as
//! `EntityCatalogDoc`: the road was built and the traffic never arrived.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ **IT DOES NOT USE `pack::prepared()`, AND THAT IS THE POINT.** That
//! function is a `OnceLock`: the first caller compiles the pack and every later
//! caller gets the same value forever, which is correct for a process that reads
//! its content once and wrong for one that re-reads it. Reload compiles a FRESH
//! pack off disk, and the `OnceLock` keeps serving the boot-time value to
//! everything that has not been migrated to a generation-aware read — which is
//! fast-iteration I3 step 1's *"replace process-global mutable-generation
//! assumptions from the OnceLock content route for migrated families with
//! App-scoped selection"*, and is NOT done here.
//!
//! ⚠ **SO A RELOAD MOVES THE CAST AND NOT THE PACK.** Move tables reach the
//! running game through the character registry, which this republishes. Every
//! other family in that pack — items, encounters, audio, boss profiles — is
//! still whatever the boot-time compile produced, and asking this function to
//! reload one of them would be asking it to lie.
