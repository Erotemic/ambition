//! **A fighter knocked off THIS platform reaches the world's edge.**
//!
//! The one claim about the stocks loop that no unit test in
//! `ambition_demo_smash` can make. Those cover spend, respawn, eliminate and
//! end, each in isolation and each correctly. What none of them can answer is
//! whether the stage's own numbers — a 420px platform in a 960px world with a
//! 220px blast margin — put the world's edge somewhere a launched body actually
//! gets to.
//!
//! That is the difference between a loop that is correct and a game that works,
//! and it is exactly the class this repository keeps rediscovering: every
//! instrument green, and green about less than it claimed.
