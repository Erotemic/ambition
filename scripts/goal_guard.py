"""Deterministic Stop-hook guard for long agent runs.

An armed goal blocks Stop and tells the agent to keep working. It does NOT run
commands: the backlog outlives any run, so there is nothing to verify and
nothing to wait for. Only a release condition ends a run — an absolute deadline,
a maximum run duration, a stalled-commit limit, or a crash fuse.

`--pause` skips one Stop; `--hold` skips Stops until `--unhold`, while deadlines
continue to run. `--extend` moves both clock-based releases. Those are the only
ways to stand the guard down: it does NOT infer one from outstanding background
work, because abandoned shells are the normal state of a long session.

Goals are repository-local but session-scoped. The first stopping session claims
an unowned goal; `--share` permits additional sessions to join the same goal.
`--resume` releases stale ownership after a session reset. Hook wiring must find
this script from any working directory and must fail closed on Stop if it cannot.

Typical commands::

    python3 scripts/goal_guard.py --arm .goal/my-run.json
    python3 scripts/goal_guard.py --status
    python3 scripts/goal_guard.py --pause "reason"
    python3 scripts/goal_guard.py --hold "reason"
    python3 scripts/goal_guard.py --unhold
    python3 scripts/goal_guard.py --extend 48h
    python3 scripts/goal_guard.py --clear

Goal files contain `goal` and release limits — nothing executable. The
historical incidents behind these rules belong in `docs/tools/goal-guard.md`."""
